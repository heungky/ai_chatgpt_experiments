Staff at the dental side, if I’m not wrong her name is Sabirah. She caters to my needs and when im unsure about something, she’ll explain it to me. Kind and friendly. I brought my daughter here some years ago and the dentist was very nice back then, so I made an appt with him. But it turned out he was having a bad day, he was actually quite rude and sarcastic at times, and he also kept snapping at the poor nurse while she was keying in details of my teeth. I don't think I'll come back here. Went to the branch sometime end of last year for a routine check and filling. I felt a rather big hole in one of my molar tooth, likely due to missing filling. But to my surprise, the Dentist said my tooth was normal and I had no missing filling even though I told him I had filling done there b4. So I took his word for it and went ahead with the normal scaling and polishing. I recently went to another dental clinic for toothache treatment and with one look, the Dentist said I had a missing filling. So for the pass 6 months or so, I have been eating with missing filling. The Dentist at RMG is inexperience. Don’t think I’ll ever go to RMG for dental treatment. Dr jonathan was very friendly and gentle. Made trips to dentist more bearable. A very detailed dentist who explained everything thoroughly. Recommend him !!! 10/10. Thank you for the great service. The female staff was kind enough to help me with my enquire about medical injection.","['Doctor/Staff/Receptionist behavior_positive', 'Dental treatment_positive', 'Service quality_positive']",1.3726181999999998,103.9495431

Please bring Dr George back to loyang point clinic. Two other clinic are always full and it's very difficult for patients having to go to a further clinic. I went there to get some medical advice after one of my friends recommended Dr. George. I was concerned about my heart, so I was relieved when he performed an ECG right away to confirm there were no problems. It was a fantastic experience; Dr. George listened to my whole medical history and made very helpful recommendations on meds as well as my diet. I know I'm in excellent hands now that I've discovered Dr. George.

Thank you Dr. George.

This clinic comes highly recommended. Even the two front desk admin staff were really kind and customer service oriented. Unfortunately, the counter staff was not helpful in helping me get my medicine. The staff at loyang point clinic told me since they are now a swabbing centre, that they do not administer my pills anymore or in the future. She simply asked me to go to another clinic and did not bother telling me where I should go.  When I called Tampines Womens Centre to ask whether they have my medicine, the staff said that I am a patient, not a worker, so I am not allowed to ask directly for stock. As a patient and loyal customer of Raffles Medical, this debacle seems so tedious and a waste of my time. The way she said was quite rude but how else am I suppose to ask? If I come to your clinic and you do not have the medicine, I have to make another trip to another clinic to find it. I hope the service can be improved. All I need is my medicine and I have to go through unnecessary stuff. Prices are usually more expensive compared to other clinics but at least thats not much of a wait. Doctors I've seen are mostly good. Nice cosy waiting area. Clinic staff are nice, patient and efficient. Doctors are great and detailed in their work.","['Doctor/Staff/Receptionist behavior_positive', 'Service quality_positive', 'Long queue/wait time_positive']",1.3664797,103.96449109999999

Bottleneck is not really at doctor consultation but more towards their registration.  Waited for more than 30mins just to register.  And dunno need to wait how long for doctor consultation. I have to ask the nurse has the registration started cause I've not seeing the queue number moving.  Then she claim they under staffs . Between they have 3 staffs at counter.  Only 1 dispensing medication.  And doctor queue is not moving as fast as well . Not sure if they are doing this on purpose as from what I've observed most patients hasn't even register.  This is posted in End Jan where covid cases isn't as peak as reported in news . Hence has this become a new normal .  I wouldn't have wanted to visit the clinic unless really necessary . If I can self medicate I wouldn't have visit .
End up I have to visit another clinic where registration is faster and they advise waiting time is 1hr to 1.5hr . At least I'm registered .

Raffles medical wwp , if this is your strategy to push away patients.  Yes you succeed because I'm not going to visit your clinic anymore . Not ever .. and this is not the first time that I've encounter this . I understand the bad situation during covid peak period but when covid has become a new normal you should really look into how to better manger your system and staffs training .

I really do not recommend patient to visit this wwp raffles branch if you are sick . It will make your sickness worse due to their operation issues.

I would have rated no stars of there is this option .
They don't deserve 1 star even Including this and past experiances, the major issue is the inexperienced staff at the counter. There have been many times where I have had to wait for over 20+ minutes to even proceed to the consultation as my registration could not be done effectively by the staff.

Today, I arrived at 12:14, only for my registration to have issues up to the point at 12:40 where I said I would have to leave as I would be late for a meeting if I were to wait. If other people can be in and out in 15 minutes, I do not see why I have to be the special 40 minute wait, and thats even without a consultation.

They informed me that I would be seen very soon, only to wait an additional 10 minutes with no news, all while others who registered after me were able to go into a consultation. Whats the point of having staff who do not know how to use your system. Either train them, or dont have them there to waste time.

This is not the first time that I have had to wait for an unreasonable amount of time, and this is the same to others who come. My sister and brother all have had extream 30-40 minute wait times, just to see the doctor, and then more waiting after seeing the doctor.

Doctors are good though, so if waiting is no issue then this is a good place to go. Worst clinic I’ve ever been to, and a discredit to the Raffles Group name. Waited 2 hours to be seen by even the nurse (not even the doc) for my health screening even though I’d made an appointment prior — and I was the first in line. Just chalked it up to them being busy and my fault for going on a day before public holiday. Requested for a teleconsult for the results of my health screening and was promised a doctor would call. Four months later, many email exchanges, empty promises and fruitless phone calls later, still no call. I have my screening but no not know what to make of it, how to interpret it and nobody to consult.Thanks for nothing. A waste of money. Will never return and highly discourage anyone who treats their health and well-being seriously and would hope to be treated by practitioners who likewise handle your health accordingly with care and professionalism. The staff is just unhelpful and very slow. I don’t understand why there is a bottleneck after the doc’s check-up. Even if the docs are friendly but the staff is slow, the overall experience is ruined. And they should be conscious that they have patients who are ill and not guests. I did not go here at first because of the bad reviews - big mistake. I saw Dr. Choudhury who was excellent, took his time, explained treatment in detail, everything made sense and has worked for me. I went through three different doctors before finally going to the one that is a three-minute walk from my apartment. Will come here again - most of the reviewers seemed to have issues with the wait/registration; I would rather wait a little and receive good care and sensible treatment.","['Long queue/wait time_negative', 'Service quality_negative', 'Rude Customer service_negative']",1.406028,103.9022535

The nurse staff, Michael, was very professional and he ensured that the vaccination was fuss free and as much as possible, pain free.
Much better than their other raffles medical outlet. I would come here just for my future vaccination and look for Michael. A bit of a long queue time as there's only 1 Dr on duty. Never thought it was possible to enjoy a Dr visit (neutral at best) but Dr Shimona was friendly, upbeat and takes time to listen before advising. Admin staff were friendly as well, taking time to explain medication. Thank you for making a patient's visit more comfortable! Agree with the other reviewers that the attitude of front desk staff is very poor. In the comments section noted how the service was notably poor for a certain race.
The clinic's also does not follow the stipulated opening and closing hours. Their reason given doctor had some other work so had to leave early.
When gave the feedback to the staff there they suggested I go to another clinic. Unfortunately my company has a tie up with Raffles clinics and Raffles insurance so have no other option. Horrible clinic. Stated in the website that it closes at 5.30pm. Reached clinic at 3.55pm and was told to leave and come back later in the evening. Then when I asked whether I can resister for the 6.30pm slot, the clinic staff told me they are close for the night also cos doc is on Medical Leave. Imagine that I come back at 6.30pm, I am still unable to see doc. Luckily I asked, if not, another water trip. Don’t really deserve the 1 star at all. I would like to commend the staff working today at Eastpoint. They attended to my mum quickly to dress her cut and stop her bleeding. Appreciate their fast action despite being busy during these trying times.","['Doctor/Staff/Receptionist behavior_positive', 'Service quality_positive', 'vaccination_positive']",1.3430618,103.9531037

I got a queue number and started waiting. After 15 mins I realized that the doctor hasn’t even arrived. When I asked the stuff on the whereabouts of the doctor, the stuff didn’t know and also didn’t know when he would be arriving. When I asked if this is usual, the stuff said usually the doctor won’t be in when the clinic is open. In my case the doctor didn’t arrive by 9am even. This is truly unacceptable. What’s the point of having the clinic open and getting patients to wait while doctors are not even in the clinic! Dr. Wicky Wong is knowledgeable and professional. The clinic is located in a well connected area which is makes it the clinic of choice for us. The operations can improve such as staff answering the phone or wait times but overall the positives outweigh the areas that could be better. Not sure why reviews are so bad but so far my three visits have been rather pleasant. Dr Wicky Wong is very patient and knowledgeable and definitely does not overprescribe meds like some other clinics do. Once I had mastitis and the receptionists showed a lot of emphathy. All 3 times my max wait had been about half an hour. I always walk in and never call. Most clinics are hard to reach by phone unless you go to one like IMC which charge an arm and a leg (my 5 min with the doc and no meds cost 120 bucks). People need to adjust expectations for the price you are paying. Walk in patient, front desk really lovely and helpful. Saw a doctor within 10 minutes. Really good experience. horrible as someone else said before.
my son had 10+year issue with eczema and we saw various doctors/specialist with same conclusion.
We run out of stock of the steriod cream so we went in to see doctor and hope to get same cream that we used for years... we got a scold and a ""lesson"". we were told by doctor to buy this medicine outside...we left with nothing.... this is the most horrible experience i had with a doctor ever... fine.","['Long queue/wait time_positive', 'Service quality_positive', 'Long queue/wait time_negative']",1.306457,103.90465

Nurses were always very polite, friendly, caring and professional. Prices are reasonable too. Just remember to call & check before going down to see if doctor is available as certain days, they are doing tele-consultation (virtual) due to doctor being at another outlet. Overall,  patient doctor and nurses. Came to do medical checkup , when I arrived , I was informed that NO DOCTOR today cause doctor took urgent leave, but why the website never updated temporarily closed? It’s still stated that the clinic was open.  And the guy who talked to me was quite rude also. I left the clinic then made appointment in other clinic. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 They never pick up any calls… I tried calling to make appointment in the past. I did a walk-in, I saw with my own eyes the phone ringing at the reception but they never bothered to pick up the call. Even though they seem to be not doing anything else, they pick up calls when they feel like it. Or tone deaf?? I’m amazed…. I have been calling the clinic for the whole morning and no one picks up the phone. Went online to book an appointment to find that there are also ‘no slots available’ on any day in the month. Are they even open??? Only reason I visited was that this clinic is in the panel list. But the doctor was not helpful. Overall, Raffles Medical seems to be falling in quality compared to before.

I took loperamide, water sloshing away in my large intestines, on the verge of another diarrhoea scenario, arriving before 1 pm, hoping to get help, but you were not open.

..... Really, not cool. I think moving on from here, I need to be my own doctor and nurse.

I am humbly very sorry, but thank you very much for making me realize this, Raffles Medical. I visited the clinic earlier on and was impressed by Lily’s hospitality once again!
She always patiently guides each patient through each step and is especially sweet to the elderly! It is very heartwarming to see how she treats everyone with respect and is always professional! Swift registration process, ethical Dr who patiently listens with empathy and prescribed a better medicine (compared to other GP) and EXCELLENT Receptionists who gave us good tips as alternative remedy to cough and proper sleeping position to open up airway. Good Job 👍. This morning I was there to do PCR test. Lily is patience to explained the procedure with me. She is gentle , polite and professional . I will definitely come back for her if needed to do PCR. Very disappointed with this branch.

Firstly, the nurse who wanted my postal code, unit number and telephone number chose to call out these questions to where I was seated. I had to walk up to her and subtly provide her these sensitive personal information instead.

Secondly, the doctor, simply tried to prescribe my 6 year old with antibiotics after (a) checking his temperature (37.1 degrees celsius), (b) visually inspecting his throat and (c) listening to my description that he had been coughing for 3 nights and in 7 months ago, he continued to cough for 2 months after ceasing to test positive for covid. What kind of doctor can be so confident to give an antibiotics prescription without supplementing with additional investigation such as an x-ray, or his weight information? And his tone and mannerism was very flippant, very casually dismissive. When I asked whether it is a good idea to have antibiotics prescribed before my son got an x-ray, the doctor quickly took back his prescription, saying that Parents should make the final call as we take responsibility of our children. I will never return to this clinic and recommend that no one else does.","['Doctor/Staff/Receptionist behavior_positive', 'Service quality_positive', 'Doctor/Staff/Receptionist behavior_negative']",1.3256333,103.9290221

They used to have good service here at Tampines1.  But since there was a change in their staff, it has become worse. Before registration and to get my number, I am always greeted by this unfriendly, stuck-up, rude Indian female who does not know how to talk professionally and courteously to the patients visiting. Loves to roll her eyes and widen her eyes when talking. As if she is so much better than everyone else. This job is not right for her. She doesn't have the people-person etiquette for this job. I would like to compliment Eddy Ngiam for excellent service rendered in Tampines1. He is so helpful, and patient with me to take detail history and verify all documents for submission. It’s takes a good vibes like him to be able to display great patience and yet was quick in his work to avoid other patients from waiting too long. Great job 👏 Mr Eddy! Keep up the good work! absolutely ridiculous service; was told over the phone that it was fine to reach before 3pm for an x-ray so i reached 10 mins before 3pm and the front desk lady told me that i was too late because the x-ray was closing. Did not let me do the x-ray and had the audacity to tell me it was my fault for not reaching earlier. Absolutely disgusted my the quality of the service and the lack of integrity that the front desk staff have. Came for medical check-up. Everything was smooth. Didn't have to wait unnecessarily long. Staff & doctors were great with the instructions. Note: You need to make an appointment. Walk-ins not accepted anymore. Had a fractured toe , ask if X-ray is available. The counter recep say it’s closed and have to wait next day for X-ray and suggested me to consult doc first.  Waited almost 30mins to see doc, doc examined and say I need a X-ray and ask if I need a referral letter to go to any hospital (because it’s urgent) and I told him I’m going raffles hospital A&E.
For goodness sake, I came with referral later and was told I still have wait at least 1.5hr to see doctor first before I can take X-ray. I thought with the referral letter I can take X-ray straight away. Nurse say that doctor have order an X-ray form instead a referral form.

I scheduled a flu vaccination appointment  by giving all my personal details thru your website. However, when I reached the clinic, I was told to queue up for registration and have to repeat giving all my information again. Not to mention, there were 5 people in front of me for registration.

Before reaching my turn of registration, I noticed there were 20 people ahead of me before my flu injection because the queue of flu injection shares with the queue of consultation of doctor.

I find it hilarious that even if i had scheduled an appt , yet I need to re-register at the counter and wait for the consultation queue with others. I was even told that there is a high chance i will only get my flu jab after 2 hours. Isn't that defeat the purpose of scheduling an appt beforehand?

I was advised by the registration counter to visit other raffles medical center, but sorry, no next time.

Unlike scheduling a covid19 vaccination with government's community center, your scheduling system and process within clinic is arduous and not systematic at all.

Adios. Bad services. They forgot to ask me to do blood test for my employment pass medical checkup. They even asked me to make payment after X-ray and meet the doctor. I told the cashier that I haven't do the blood test yet. She said that I need to wait. So I wanted for another hour. Then I go back to ask when can I do my blood test. She is like ""Har, you haven't make your blood test"". I bet that they totally forgot to ask me to do the blood test. During the blood test, the nurse say that its very hard to take asome blood from me and she tool very long time just to take a blood test. The only nice thing is the doctor is nice. Wasn't open when I was around at 2am but looks decent enough. I believe it is meant to be 24 hours. I felt, the doctor was good. He was old and experienced.

Considering that I booked a slot in advance, I'd expect the clinic to set aside my dose but no, they allowed me to book and confirm and later left my scheduled appointment hanging in the air. Unprofessional and unethical. Irresponsible consultant, lost credit for this medical group, never visit back.
Only for standard service like swab test or health check up maybe can still give a try, but if you have serious issues need to check, must go to other clinic to consult.
Poor quality and monitoring of the consultant service, I believe people who comes to clinic would really need help, but the doctor here very proud of the “I give you the professional advice” which is just pain killer to solve your problem and try to tolerate your issue yourself, without any empathy to understand the patient’s really pain points.

Unfortunately the place is small and the queue is quite long. I've reserved time for health screening, but when I come I still need to wait quite a long time (almost 1 hour). So if you come to this place for screening or check up, please have a spare time. Tested positive for dengue, and the first two visits were amazing (for blood tests) - doctor was nice, receptionist was attentive and saw I was distressed and hurried the process along. During my third visit, the (newer) receptionist did not even bother asking what was wrong and hurried my out of the clinic and told me I “would be called in”. When another person entered, she was tended to first, even though she reached later than me. When given my ID, the receptionist immediately said they couldn’t process it, to which I responded - I’ve been here on Friday and Saturday and they were processed just fine. The best part is after you’ve gotten the queue number, the wait time is still almost an hour to two hours long. If you have the option of changing clinics, please do so. I wasn't very impressed with the doctor during my evening visit recently. There were only 2+ patients and he was taking his own sweet time. I waited almost an hour and went for my consult only to be told that my complaints of dizzy spells, headache and eye pain over the past month was ""normal"". The doctor looked tired, and I did not feel he wanted to work with me to figure out what was wrong. I was prescribed generic eyedrops that I could've just gotten from Guardian. I recommend going in the morning or afternoon for better service. On top of this, evening consults cost more. I called to only ask if I can get a medicine because the doctor prescribed me but it didn’t work. The doctor never checked on me only relied to what I was experiencing. So I thought it was just period pain. But seems like gastric.

The lady who answered my call was very rude. She doesn’t even showed any compassion nor empathy. If cannot get the medicine and have to see the doctors she could’ve said it nice and friendly manner!  in the first place this is customer service etiquette. VERY RUDE AND SHE DISCONNECTED THE CALL RIGHT WALL. RAFFLES CLINIC STAFF,  YOUR BEHAVIOUR TOWARDS YOUR CLIENTS CAN BE IMPROVED!  You don’t have any idea what the patients are going through!!!!

SO disappointed! I’m not seeing doctor in your clinic anymore! I wanted to scan for registration but the staff said no need. Perhaps she was trying to help as she saw that I was a senior citizen. Then she started enumerating my personal info, from my full name to my address, to my Ic number & date of birth for all waiting in the reception to hear.
My pain didn’t end there. To collect my medicine, another one of the staff asked me my date of birth. I’m totally stunned! Why not ask for my full name or last 4 digit of my Ic. Why need to let everyone in the reception including other patients know my dob? Where is your PDPA practice?","['Doctor/Staff/Receptionist behavior_negative', 'Long queue/wait time_negative', 'Service quality_negative']",1.372692,103.94959

Everything is in a mess. No direction as to where to register or medicine dispensary. Everything  is mess. No proper queueing system. The indian lady at the counter should be more empathy.  She is rude. Probaly didn’t get her weekend off approve. Very loud when speaking to patients. However, with her own race, she is nice. She need to be trained in treating patient equally. Unlike her partner who is soft spoken. I’ve went to many RMG, most of them have proper system. Unlike this clinic. There registration system should be at the front next to the registration counter. It should not be far from the registration counter.  Staff should be more empathy to patient not raising your voice to patient, after all RMG is the famous brand in Singapore. i understand why this clinic has such rating. i reached before around 12:40 and that was before their 1pm closing. the staff refused to let me take number and asked me to come back at 2pm and claimed that there were a lot of patients. but i was like, i can come back at 2pm but i still can get number first right? that was a guy nurse, on 6 feb 2023. i must say, that's very unprofessional way of handling.
well, i guess all the bad reviews here won't do any improvement. no one will attend to this and the clinic will continue to have ""business"". Horrendous service staff. The staff at the counter are full of attitude and think they are doing us a favour. The Indian lady at the counter is THE WORST!!!!

Wait time for consulting are long but the actual time doctor spends on the patient is a jiffy.

Waiting for medicines takes even longer and the staff feel no responsibility to provide a proper ETA. Lot of irate patients waiting helplessly as it's a Sunday evening and this among the few clinics open in the neighborhood!!!

Don't go unless you absolutely have to.

Google should have a 0* option for such service providers. The registration process is one of the worst I've seen. It must be highly inefficient for the consultation queue to be faster than the registration queue itself. I spent more of my time waiting to register than I did to see the doctor.

Raffles clinic sk really needs to work on a more efficient registration system. I have been using Raffles for many years now . For a private clinic there prices are reasonable. Wish they would ask to write perscription for medication .  There dispensing  of medication is very slow . But compared to Gov. Hospital its a bit faster . There staff has always been very professional and friedly . I like the old que number system better the one before covid. I give 4 stars because i think there could be improvement in the way they dispence medication a little more timely .","['Doctor/Staff/Receptionist behavior_negative', 'Rude Customer service_negative', 'Long queue/wait time_negative']",1.3924119,103.8952975

Of course I didn’t get well, went to another clinic which was much2 better, nice and thoughtful Dr gave me 3days mc from 13-15Jan23 for me to recuperate at home. Definitely not going to this clinic again. 👎  👎 Extremely understaffed. One single person does registration, dispense and queue update. One doctor. Took 1.5 hours for an off peak time. You cannot estimate the time it will take since missed queue number is not updated on board and they are randomly called.

They also didn’t have antibiotics so have to go and purchase meds which would have been covered under our CIGNA originally.

Out of all the raffles I have been to this is probably the slowest. Doctor is good.

Update: sent us to Watsons in the mall for meds and they said they don’t keep any. I went to clinic at almost 11am, when i made my registration i was told that there was only 2 patients in front of me. Upon registration i was asked to do ART because i had flu and cough symptoms. Process was fast until after my ART i wasn’t aware that my queue number was already called. And i wasted almost 30 mins. Wish there is better process Come here only for serology test, come for 4pm appointment, wait until 6pm and never get called. I cannot imagine what will happen for people with severe problems when they need to wait this long .... If you have a lot of free time, you are very welcome to spend it here (outside the clinic) because it would be very well WASTED. Went there yesterday and was shocked to hear they have no doctors and e best thing they did not even bother to update in google,what a BIG JOKE!!!!!?

Doctor was attentive n the only nurse around was not stressed. Guess the company need to do some work in this clinic to raise morale n b patient centric! Counter staffs does not smile. Not welcoming. I realised they actually off the phone ringing tone. So when we call them, the phone doesn't ring. So is this how u avoid phone calls? The malay staff with thr head scarf is polite. The guy at the counter and the lady with spectacles have a rude attitude! The worst clinic I've been to. Staff attitude is bad and the doctor was just giving vague diagnosis that could be simply googled to understand more. Maybe cos we were the last patient, everyone there just couldn't wait to knock off. Honestly even 1 star is too many.. Nurses are nice and professional. Places are ok. But ,man, the Physician, specifically,  the male doctor, is horrible. Attitude aside, he is just incompetent.

Here is my personal experience: He told me that a cyst might take up to one month to go away. So I trusted him and waited. 2 months past, it’s still there. After a bit of study online, it’s clear that it takes years to heal if no procedure taken. Luckily I was treated elsewhere. But still, thank you for the delay you dxckhead piece of shxt.

I would highly recommend Raffles to DQ that guy. Called in to book an appointment. The tone and attitude of the nurse is unbearably horrible that I didn't get the appointment. Came here and read all the reviews, now thanking my stars and booking elsewhere.","['Doctor/Staff/Receptionist behavior_negative', 'Service quality_negative', 'Rude Customer service_negative']",1.392256,103.904421

Need to wait atleast 1 hour. Happened 3 times like that.as it is nearer i used to go there. Unfortunately, the counter staff was not helpful in helping me get my medicine. The staff at loyang point clinic told me since they are now a swabbing centre, that they do not administer my pills anymore or in the future. She simply asked me to go to another clinic and did not bother telling me where I should go.  When I called Tampines Womens Centre to ask whether they have my medicine, the staff said that I am a patient, not a worker, so I am not allowed to ask directly for stock. As a patient and customer of Raffles Medical, this debacle seems so tedious and a waste of my time. The way she said was quite rude but how else am I suppose to ask? If I come to your clinic and you do not have the medicine, I have to make another trip to another clinic to find it. I hope the service can be improved. All I need is my medicine and I have to go through unnecessary stuff. Same experience as another reviewer. I made appointments . I arrived on time .. But they tell me need to wait because patients that are 2 hours before me, still haven’t see yet ?! I think if they take in urgent walk in case then, at least have the courtesy to call me and advise me to come in later or if I still want to go ahead with my appointment … Friendly staff nan","['Doctor/Staff/Receptionist behavior_negative', 'Rude Customer service_negative', 'Dental treatment_negative']",1.354212,103.9450352
